## Installation
If you have setuptools, installed:
```
python setup.py install
```

_If 'setuptools' is not installed:_
```
python externs/ez_setup.py -U setuptools
```

Note, Only **guarantee** success to install **'linux'** system and **'debian', 'redhat', 'centos'** linux distribution. And install system libraries too using 'apt-get' or 'yum'
