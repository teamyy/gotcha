## Installation
If you have setuptools, installed:
```
python setup.py install
```

_If 'setuptools' is not installed:_
```
python externs/ez_setup.py -U setuptools
```

If you just want to install only the dependency libraries
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

_If 'pip' is not installed:_
```
python externs/get-pip.py && pip install -U pip
```
